# Brain-Tumor-Detector
A project I made to get accustomed to computer vision and YOLOv5 with Roboflow. This project detects possible tumors in MRI brain scans. I hope to later add a frontend to interact with this model and upload custom images easier. 

Best weights: yolov5/runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection
